            <h3>That was a quick overview of the evolution of our design, now let us explain the process.</h3>
            <br>
            <h3>THE PROBLEM</h3>
            <p>People find searching for apartments to be a very stressful endeavor, there are many resources available online but none really provide an insight into what living in the apartment is really like.</p>
            <p>We wanted to help out by designing a system that helps users by providing them with a space where they can look for apartments, see what other people are saying about those apartments and express their opinions about their current living situations.</p>
            
            <h3>COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS</h3>
            <p>We started out by studying the existing resources available and this is what we found.</p>
            <p><b>Apartments.com</b> - Allows renters to search for places to rent and view amenities but there is no mechanism to see what it is like to live there.</p>
            <p><b>Apartmentlist.com</b> - Similar to the previous website with slightly more details but no reviews available.</p>
            <p><b>Airbnb</b> - Has a pretty comprehensive review mechanism but not really meant for long-term living spaces.</p>
            <p><b>Yelp.com</b> - Had several reviews about apartment communities but there were significant issues when it came to whether the reviews can be trusted.</p>
            <p><b>Google Maps</b> - Had good photo resolution on the apartment images and has reviews but they were too general.</p>
            <br>
            <p>This analysis showed that there was a market for our idea especially if we can include a good mechanism for reviews that can be trusted by the user.</p>
            
            <h3>USER RESEARCH</h3>
            <p>To understand the real needs and motivations of our users we interviewed nine individuals who fell into three broad categories students, working professionals and families.</p>
            <p>We asked them questions to understand what their process of searching for apartments is like, what they find difficult and what resources they wish they had.</p>
            <p>After the interviews we undertook a process of affinity diagramming to determine if there were common themes and patterns among what the interviewees said.</p>
            <p>This is what we found:</p>
            <ul class="indent">
                <li>All users start off with a priority list in mind and look for places that meet the criteria.</li>
                <li>The exact priorities will vary based on each individual‚Äôs stage in life.</li>
                <li>Users believe reviews are a good mechanism to get feedback on an apartment but had concerns about the reliability of reviews.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <h3>PERSONAS</h3>
            <img src="images/brandon.png" alt="brandon persona" class="responsive">
            <p>Based on the interviews and affinity diagrams we came up with three personas to serve as helpful guides during the design process.</p>
            <p>The following describes how we translated one of the personas (Brandon‚Äôs) need into an app feature. Brandon is an Engineering student.</p>
            <p><b>Quote:<i>"I want to live in a place that is close to campus, has a lot of facilities and is very safe".</i></b></p>
            <p><b>User Story:<i>"As a student I want to see only genuine reviews by actual people so that I can trust what is said."</i></b></p>
            <p><b>App Feature:<i>"Given that a user wants to leave a review when they are on the leave  a review page then include address proof upload option."</i></b></p>
            <p>These app features then led to the Phase 1 Design seen previously.</p>
            
            <h3>USER EVALUATION</h3>
            <p>We presented the Phase 1 Design to six users and asked them to perform simple tasks such as clicking through and finding certain pages or telling us what they thought would happen based on a certain button click. We encouraged them to talk-out-loud during the process so we could understand their assumptions. This was done to help us understand the issues users have with the current design.</p>
            <p>Based on the identified issues we modified our design resulting in our Phase 2 design and then translated that into the color based high-fidelity Phase 3 design.</p>

            <h3>HEURISTIC EVALUATION</h3>
            <p>The Phase 3 design is very nearly what we had envisioned for our product but in order to make sure that we had no other usability issues, we evaluated the phase 3 design against <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/">Nielsen's 10 Heuristics.</a></p>
            <p>This helped us to identify things we had overlooked like the user not knowing the system status, not being able to recover from errors or inconsistencies in the internal design.</p> 
            <p>We then updated our design again keeping in mind these heuristics and finally we were ready with our Final Design.</p>
            <p>You can view the entire Final App Design on <a href="https://www.figma.com/file/NQYfTSTBdoDQZcXH1yOHxU/Final?node-id=0%3A1">Figma</a></p>
            
            <h3>INSIGHTS FROM INTERVIEWS AND EVALUATIONS</h3>
            <p>Through our user interviews we learnt that there was an element of distrust among users when it came to reviews. This caused us to pause and consider how we can build trust in our system leading to the ID verification sections in our app.</p>
            <p>User evaluations revealed that people need proper descriptive elements not only as labels but also as a means to understand the very purpose of the page. This caused us to refine our textual description, for example ‚ÄúLeave a review‚Äù was changed to ‚ÄúReview this apartment here‚Äù thus making clear to users what the specific purpose of the text box is.</p>
            <p>Heuristic Evaluations helped us better understand other usability issues that we missed like not being able to go back to the previous page or undo an action.</p>
            
            <h3>REFLECTIONS</h3>
            <p>Through the process of designing this app we learnt to really listen to the users and prioritize their needs. Our product idea had a value in the market and our review mechanism was a unique feature among the competition but we needed to build in an element of trust. </p>
            <p>Through the process of user and heuristic evaluations we came to recognize that in our enthusiasm for our product we had sometimes not put the needs of the user first. </p>
            <p>Overall UX design requires us to always keep in mind the users, their goals, needs and priorities and only when we design with users in mind do we build a truly great product.</p>
